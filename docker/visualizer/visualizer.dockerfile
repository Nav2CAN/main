# Install the remote desktop stuff
# - TigerVNC is a X server/frame buffer and VNC server in one. Earlier I used xvfb and
#   x11vnc in combination, but I had trouble letting the client resize the desktop.
#   TigerVNC solves this, plus it seems faster. 
# - xfce4 is a window manager. If we did not include this, we would be able to render
#   into X but there would be no windows, menus etc. I tried to include Gnome instead,
#   for a more familiar Ubuntu experience, but that took up a lot of space and wouldn't
#   actually run because it needed the systemd daemon, and that became too cumbersome.
# - novnc is a vnc client that connects to the VNC server and presents the desktop
#   in a web browser. This way the user does not need to have a pc with a VNC client
#   installed. We use the port 8080 for this. So that the user should type "<ip>:8080/vnc.html"
#   into their browser.
# - supervisor is a light weight process manager, a bit like systemd. We use it to launch
#   the above tools with the right settings. It also relaunches them if they crash.
